Where are the translations?
---------------------------

The translations made are in the `contribute/grammar` folder which has the following minimal structure.

<!-- FOLDER STRUCT. AUTO - START -->

    + doc
        * LICENSE.txt
        * README.md
        + changes
            * LICENSE.txt

<!-- FOLDER STRUCT. AUTO - END -->


Start a new translation
-----------------------

As the author of `amo-grammar` is a French amateur coder, the documentation is only actively maintained in French. Here is how to translate it.

  1. Start by copying and pasting the main `grammar` folder where you want to do your translation.

  1. Simply translate the contents of `desc` and `name`. Other parts of each file may be useful for explanations.

  1. Once the work is well advanced, or even finished, send it to the author of `amo-grammar`.
