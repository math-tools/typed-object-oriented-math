------------------------
"Addition-product" field
------------------------

A "add-prod" field ''F'' is a field with the syntaxic shortcuts of
an "add-prod" ring.

note::
    We could have extended just a ''DivRing'' type because of the
    abelian properties of the ''GroupAdd'' and ''GroupProd'' types.
    We choose the ''Field'' type in order to reflect the \struct
    extensions made in \maths.

           GrpOpProd : GroupProd
